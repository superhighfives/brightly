# Ten Years

## April 1, 2023

> "I've been listening to this song for almost a decade. It's depressing how fast the time flows."<br />
> —Enzo Ponce Cano

It's hard to believe that it's been _ten years_ since we released [Beginnings & Endings](https://wearebrightly.bandcamp.com/album/beginnings-endings), our debut album. Though it was, by all formal measures, a brief and bright _(lol)_ flash in the pan, it had an outsized impact on us, and around us. Even today it still somehow holds people's attention, and it grew itself an incredibly dedicated fanbase of people—people who reach out to tell us what it meant to them, how much they loved it, how depressing it was (see above). One guy told us it was his favourite record to do LSD to. Every single message meant the world.

**Brightly** started out in the living room of my brother's place in Sandringham, in Melbourne, around 2010 or 2011. I was sleeping in the spare room, on the verge of dropping out of doing a masters in computer science. I'd started thinking about studying sound production, and I'd just bought [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/) and a [Novation Launchpad](https://novationmusic.com/en/launch). I booked a gig at _The Brunswick Hotel_ and showed up with a laptop and an aux cable, and sang two songs while the sound person looked on, visibly disappointed with the mix. One song was called _Seven Years_, and the other eventually became _Tokyo_ (originally recorded with a [surreal, terrible faux-American accent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA77r0aGtpM), an inexplicably weird creative decision on my part which led to re-recording a lot of vocals early on). _Nic_ came and watched, for some reason saw something in it, and introduced me to _Josh_ and [Ony](https://andreieremin.com/) (Andrei, our producer extraordinaire). And that was it.

[Beginnings & Endings](https://wearebrightly.bandcamp.com/album/beginnings-endings) was the start of a ton of creative projects. [The Beginnings & Endings Project](https://beginnings.wearebrightly.com) encouraged sharing the album to get it free, and [Tweetflight](https://tweetflight.wearebrightly.com/) was Twitter-karaoke for the lead single (which is still the only truly original great idea I've ever had). It opened a ton of doors for us, introduced us to [Ceres](https://ceresband.bandcamp.com/), [Japanese Wallpaper](https://www.japanese-wallpaper.com/), [Tim Shiel](https://www.timshiel.com/), [Gotye](http://www.gotye.com/), some of our earliest and biggest supporters. [Renee Anderson](https://www.instagram.com/renee_anderson_music) sang on Fox, [Simon Lam](https://www.instagram.com/sssimonlam/) sang on Tea, [Marcus Franco](https://www.instagram.com/marcus.xciii/) played sax across the album. People like _Tim Lucas_ and [John Barton](https://johnbarton.co/) helped build all the little projects, [Glen Maddern](https://glenmaddern.com/) basically masterminded all of them. _Will Dayble_ stepped in to help promote it in ways we couldn't have imagined, like through _The Pirate Bay_. [Samara Clifford](https://samaraclifford.com/) took incredible photos of us, and got on board with every ridiculous thought we ever had. [James Seymour](https://www.jseymourproduction.com/) and <em>We The People</em> supported us at the launch, and after. The album introduced us to a million bands, artists, DJ's, producers, sound people, radio hosts, bar staff and agents across the Melbourne music scene. It got us a publishing contract. It felt unreal. It still does.

  Aside: I am 100% aware that I will have missed so many people from the list
  above, so it is by no means definitive or exhaustive. Thank you to everyone
  single person who was a part of it.

As the anniversary approached, I started collating [all the reviews, features, interviews and media](/#reviews-and-media), tripping down memory lane. I was an archivist possessed. It felt important, like saving a little piece of ourselves. I trawled through our history, reliving it, disecting it, [and collected it here](/)—so much of that time already feels like a distant memory.

Looking back I think we were optimstic and excited, and maybe a little different, at a time when music press was celebrated for being cynical and jaded. _Vice Magazine_ had made hating things cool, and on reflection, I was deeply naive about how to navigate that side of the business (which is, for better or worse, necessary). I worried too much about what music press thought, and we'd pore over reviews, giving them too much energy. I still remember when _Beat Magazine_ described [Preflight Nerves](https://tweetflight.wearebrightly.com/) as <em>"An odd mix of glitch and folk pop sung in a very pronounced Australian accent. The vocals are strong and vaguely queer, with a tremulous, melodramatic edge that is heightened by the flickering, warping instrumental samples. Interesting. Certainly pretty original."</em> To this day, I still don't really know if they liked it. (And in 2012, callng something queer in the mainstream press had a significantly different connotation than it does now.)

With that said, I think the thing I'm proudest of is the way this record, and _Brightly_ generally, brought people together. All these wildly imaginative creative weirdos, coming up with silly ideas and collaborating to make them a reality. It's one of the times in my life where I've felt like a group of people were truly greater than the sum of their parts.

To everyone who took the time to listen, share, review, and participate, thank you. It was an incredible thing to have made, and I'm so grateful we got to make it.

### Download the Discography

So here we are, ten years on. To celebrate this milestone, _I'm releasing all of Brightly's music for free_. You can [grab it on Bandcamp](https://wearebrightly.bandcamp.com/), or you can [get all the original WAV files](https://github.com/superhighfives/brightly-releases), if you'd prefer something more lossless.

### Projects and Experiments

I've also gone through and released [all of the code behind our interactive music videos, open source](https://github.com/superhighfives/brightly). I've tried, where possible, to make them work on modern devices, and to make it easier to fork them and create your own. You can [learn more about each individual project here](https://github.com/superhighfives/brightly).

I am, if possible, more proud of [Beginnings & Endings](https://wearebrightly.bandcamp.com/album/beginnings-endings) now than I was then, and it's the people who love it that make that possible. Brightly went on to make another [two albums and an EP](https://wearebrightly.bandcamp.com/), and it's by no means over, but for now that is its legacy. Thank you again for being a part of it.
