# Ten Years

> "I've been listening to this song for almost a decade. It's depressing how fast the time flows."<br />
> —Enzo Ponce Cano

It's hard to believe that it's been a decade since we released [Beginnings & Endings](https://wearebrightly.bandcamp.com/album/beginnings-endings), our debut album. Though it was, by all formal measures, a brief and bright _(lol)_ flash in the pan, it had an outsized impact on us, and around us. Even today it still somehow holds people's attention, and it grew itself an incredibly dedicated fanbase of people—people who reach out to tell us what it meant to them, how much they loved it, how depressing it was (see above). One guy told us it was his favourite record to do LSD to. Every single message meant the world.

**Brightly** started out in the living room of my brother's place in Sandringham, in Melbourne, around 2010 or 2011. I was sleeping in the spare room, on the verge of dropping out of doing a masters in computer science, thinking about studying sound production, and I'd just bought [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/) and a [Novation Launchpad](https://novationmusic.com/en/launch). I booked a gig at The Brunswick Hotel and showed up with a laptop and an aux cable, and sang two songs while the sound person looked on, visibly disappointed with the mix. One song was called Seven Years, and the other eventually became [Tokyo (originally recorded with a surreal, terrible faux-American accent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA77r0aGtpM), an inexplicably weird creative decision on my part which led to re-recording a lot of vocals early on). Nic came and watched, for some reason saw something in it, and introduced me to Josh and [Ony](https://andreieremin.com/). And that was it.

[Beginnings & Endings](https://wearebrightly.bandcamp.com/album/beginnings-endings) was the start of a ton of creative projects. [The Beginnings & Endings Project](https://beginnings.wearebrightly.com) encouraged sharing the album to get it free, and [Tweetflight](https://tweetflight.wearebrightly.com/) was Twitter-karaoke for the lead single (which is still the only truly original great idea I've ever had). It opened a ton of doors for us, introduced us to [Ceres](https://ceresband.bandcamp.com/), [Japanese Wallpaper](https://www.japanese-wallpaper.com/), [Tim Shiel](https://www.timshiel.com/), [Gotye](http://www.gotye.com/), some of our earliest and biggest supporters. [Renee Anderson](https://www.instagram.com/renee_anderson_music) sang on Fox, [Simon Lam](https://www.instagram.com/sssimonlam/) sang on Tea, [Marcus](https://www.instagram.com/marcus.xciii/) played sax across the album. People like _Tim Lucas_ and [John Barton](https://johnbarton.co/) helped build all the little projects, [Glen Maddern](https://glenmaddern.com/) masterminded most of them. _Will Dayble_ stepped in to help promote it in ways we couldn't have imagined, like through _The Pirate Bay_. [Samara Clifford](https://samaraclifford.com/) took incredible photos of us, and got on board with every silly idea we ever had. [James Seymour](https://www.jseymourproduction.com/) and <em>We The People</em> supported us at the launch, and after. It introduced us to a million bands, artists, DJ's, producers, sound people, radio hosts, bar staff and agents across the Melbourne music scene. It got us a publishing contract. It was an incredible experience.

  I am 100% aware that I will have missed so many people from the list above, so
  it is by no means definitive or exhaustive. Thank you to everyone who was a
  part of it.

As the anniversary approached, I started collating [all the reviews, features, interviews and media](/#reviews-and-media), tripping down memory lane. I was an archivist possessed. It felt important, like saving a piece of history. I trawled through our history, [and collected it here](/)—so much of that time feels like a distant memory, and it feels good to relive pieces of it.

On its release, reviews were almost universarily positive, but sometimes not. Sometimes they were absolutely confounding. We'd pour over them, giving them too much energy. _Beat Magazine_ described [Preflight Nerves](https://tweetflight.wearebrightly.com/) as <em>"An odd mix of glitch and folk pop sung in a very pronounced Australian accent. The vocals are strong and vaguely queer, with a tremulous, melodramatic edge that is heightened by the flickering, warping instrumental samples. Interesting. Certainly pretty original."</em> To this day, I still don't really know if they liked it. Looking back I think we were optimstic and excited and different, at a time when music press was celebrated for being consistently cynical and jaded. Vice Magazine made hating things cool, and on reflection, I was deeply naive. That said, if I had my time again I'm not sure if I would've changed a thing.

To everyone who took the time to listen, share, review, and participate, thank you. It was an incredible thing to have made, and I'm so grateful we got to make it.

## Download the Discography

So here we are, ten years on. To celebrate this milestone, **I'm releasing all of Brightly's music for free**. You can [grab it on Bandcamp](https://wearebrightly.bandcamp.com/), or you can [get all the original WAV files](https://github.com/superhighfives/brightly-releases), if you'd prefer something more lossless.

## Projects and Experiments

I've also gone through and released [all of the code behind our interactive music videos, open source](https://github.com/superhighfives/brightly). I've tried, where possible, to make them work on modern devices, and to make it easier to fork them and create your own. You can [learn more about each individual project here](https://github.com/superhighfives/brightly).

I am, if possible, more proud of [Beginnings & Endings](https://wearebrightly.bandcamp.com/album/beginnings-endings) now than I was then, and it's the people who love it that make that possible. Brightly went on to make another [two albums and an EP](https://wearebrightly.bandcamp.com/), and it's by no means over, but for now that is its legacy. Thank you again for being a part of it.
